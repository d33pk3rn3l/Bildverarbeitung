### Known issues
- If you run into errors like 
    ```
    QObject::moveToThread: Current thread (0x2ab1aa0) is not the object's thread (0x312d4d0).
    Cannot move to target thread (0x2ab1aa0)

    qt.qpa.plugin: Could not load the Qt platform plugin "xcb" in "/scratch2/shengyu/predator/lib/python3.8/site-packages/cv2/qt/plugins" even though it was found.
    This application failed to start because no Qt platform plugin could be initialized. Reinstalling the application may fix this problem.

    Available platform plugins are: xcb, eglfs, linuxfb, minimal, minimalegl, offscreen, vnc, wayland-egl, wayland, wayland-xcomposite-egl, wayland-xcomposite-glx, webgl.

    Aborted
    ```

    Please uninstall ```opencv_python``` and instead ```opencv_python_headless``` instead:
    ```
    pip uninstall opencv_python
    pip install opencv_python_headless
    ```
- If you have problems with installing libs. on MacOS system, please first check if you can successfully install ```scipy```, if not, you might have to install ```gcc``` first by running:
    ```
    brew install gcc
    ```

- If you are a Mac user and have problems with install PyQt5 via ```pip install```, please consider using ```conda install``` instead, you can still use ```pip install``` under an anaconda environment by first running:
```
conda install pip
```
